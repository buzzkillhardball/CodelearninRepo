  "body": "\r\n***I am on a mission! I am trying to collect code and learn how to code properly with all the code i collect.. I want \r\nto learn all sorts of different code along with infoSec and pintesting as well. I am starting classes which will be throwing me all sorts of code as we go a long. I am collecting a bunch of repos that i find interesting ether to keep up with the mods, and/or to keep my software updated. I do not have anyone helping or contributing anything as of yet but i am looking forward to working with anyone who wants to help me find my way. Now i know this site is really scattered and i dont have any idea what will become of all my code as we go a long but my idea is to develop an app that till basiclly be a collection of different code and styles along with different languages in order to compare and evauate which code works best for the job/project at hand. I guess you could maybe call it a standalone database of different coding projects that will be ever expanding... THis is the very beginning and i cant wat to see what we will pull off if everyone can pitch in just a little. ",
